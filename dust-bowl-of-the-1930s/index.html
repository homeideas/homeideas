<p>In 1933, there were 38 storms. Throughout most of the 1930s and into the early 1940s, the dust bowl turned much of what�s now known as the american heartland into a virtual wasteland. An example of a time this happened was during the early 1930s. Imagine soil so dry that plants disappear and dirt blows past your door like sand. That’s what really happened during the dust bowl.</p>

The Dust Bowl Life Styles IV..The 1930�s&hellip;Great</p>
<p>The dust bowl was a sizeable drought that destroyed the agriculture of the midwest united states. At the same time, the climatic effects all but dried up an already depressed american economy in the 1930�s creating millions of dollars in damages. It covered tens of millions of acres of land and affected states such as oklahoma, texas, colorado, kansas, and new mexico. ­the seeds of the dust bowl may have been sowed during the early 1920s.

<p>Unsustainable farming practices worsened the drought’s effect, killing the crops that kept the soil in place. And if any group should summon such a stare, it�s those who lived through the dust bowl, the worst manmade ecological disaster in american history. It now describes the area in the united states most affected by the storms, including western kansas, eastern colorado, northeastern new mexico, and the oklahoma and texas panhandles. It was the worst drought in north america in 1,000 years. Throughout most of the 1930s and into the early 1940s, the dust bowl turned much of what�s now known as the american heartland into a virtual wasteland.</p>
