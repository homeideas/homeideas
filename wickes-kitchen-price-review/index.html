We managed to agree on a fantastic price and design. We have a dream kitchen, thanks to wickes milton keynes. 30/10/2020 by chrisboogle (1 review written) good morning i`ve just had my intelliga glencoe kitchen finished by david ogle builders hired by wickes to carry out fitment of our kitchen as per our requirements designed and measured by wickes. Kitchen compare works with many big brands such as b&amp;q to ensure that you get the best price for your kitchen renovation.</p>
