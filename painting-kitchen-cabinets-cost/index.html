Luxury Average Cost to Paint Kitchen (Dengan gambar)</p>
<p>Painting your kitchen will also help to give it a real personal touch. The kitchen cabinet painting projects that we’ve quoted this year run from $1,550 for a small kitchen up to $9,400 for a very big and complicated job. Expect to pay between $277 and $675 for labor with favourable site conditions. The national average cost to repaint kitchen cabinets runs anywhere from $1200 to $7000 you can tack on even more when we take into consideration things like paint quality and cabinet design. Actual costs will depend on job size, conditions, and options.</p>
