Inside cabinets are in perfect condition. There are a lot of good reasons to go with an ikea kitchen if you’re remodeling, most notably the good price and modern design. Particle board and mdf, two common materials for stock cabinets, are susceptible to water and have a shorter life span than plywood and wood.</p>

IKEA HEMNES White Stain, Light Brown Glassdoor</p>
<p>The kitchen has been dismantled. There are a lot of good reasons to go with an ikea kitchen if you’re remodeling, most notably the good price and modern design. Fortunately, ikea creates kitchen cabinets that are easy to install. I was very impressed with the quality of the products. Get the real wood look &amp; feel without the real wood liability.</p>
