<p>White kitchen with stacked wall cabinets, custom range hood, and large island with plenty of seating. Shaker cabinet doors, simple crown moldings, and contemporary color schemes are telltale signs of transitional design. Transitional open white kitchen designer kerrie kelly gave this kitchen a light and open feel, making it the ideal space for entertaining groups of friends and family both large and small. White cabinets with maple stained island; A colorful patterned backsplash works because it’s limited to the range area.</p>
