<p>As a rule of thumb a budget bathroom renovation in a small bathroom can be as low as 5000 while a major renovation in a larger bathroom can cost 25000 or more. The final price will always depend on the bathroom size of course. Ask yourself if your bathroom needs just a facelift or a full remodel and work around it. How much does it cost to gut a bathroom. Remodeling a small bathroom costs 2500 to 10000 depending on if its a full half-bath or powder room.</p>
