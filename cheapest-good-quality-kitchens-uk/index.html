<p>My neice bought one of their kitchens and i visited their showroom in yorkshire and while i agree their kitchens are beautiful, good quality and they have a large range, i would have to say that if they âwereâ very cheap, they are not any longer and at the time of writing are about to impose a price increase.

We have an extensive range of designer kitchens such as siematic , poggenpohl , smallbone of devizes , schuller , harvey jones , warendorf , eggersman , leitch and household named family brands like. We also have many other kitchens at our showroom so why not take the time to pay us a visit. As a very rough guide, when designing a kitchen on a budget, it is sensible to spend a maximum of five per cent of the overall value of your house on a new kitchen to avoid losing money if you sell. Kitchen cabinets in our solid wood kitchens, both traditional and modern designs.</p>
