<p>My neice bought one of their kitchens and i visited their showroom in yorkshire and while i agree their kitchens are beautiful, good quality and they have a large range, i would have to say that if they âwereâ very cheap, they are not any longer and at the time of writing are about to impose a price increase. Contact us 0113 370 8515 or use the live chat feature on our website to connect directly with our representatives. The shaker in solid oak is one of our best sellers.</p>

We have an extensive range of designer kitchens such as siematic , poggenpohl , smallbone of devizes , schuller , harvey jones , warendorf , eggersman , leitch and household named family brands like. We also have many other kitchens at our showroom so why not take the time to pay us a visit. As a very rough guide, when designing a kitchen on a budget, it is sensible to spend a maximum of five per cent of the overall value of your house on a new kitchen to avoid losing money if you sell. Kitchen cabinets in our solid wood kitchens, both traditional and modern designs.</p>
