It now describes the area in the united states most affected by the storms, including western kansas, eastern colorado, northeastern new mexico, and the oklahoma and texas panhandles. Three million people left their farms on the great plains during the drought and half a million migrated to other states, almost all to the west. More and more dust storms had been blowing up in the years leading up to that day. Nasa scientists have an explanation for one of the worst climatic events in the history of the united states, the dust bowl drought, which devastated the great plains and all but dried up an already depressed american economy in the 1930�s.</p>

20 Tragic Photos from America�s Dust Bowl in the 1930s in</p>
<p>More and more dust storms had been blowing up in the years leading up to that day. While the economic decline caused by the great depression played a role, it was har­dly the only guilty party. By 1934, it was estimated that 100 million acres of farmland had lost all or most of the topsoil to the winds. The dust bowl was a severe drought that hit the u.s. At the same time, the climatic effects all but dried up an already depressed american economy in the 1930�s creating millions of dollars in damages.</p>
