It now describes the area in the united states most affected by the storms, including western kansas, eastern colorado, northeastern new mexico, and the oklahoma and texas panhandles. Three million people left their farms on the great plains during the drought and half a million migrated to other states, almost all to the west. More and more dust storms had been blowing up in the years leading up to that day. Nasa scientists have an explanation for one of the worst climatic events in the history of the united states, the dust bowl drought, which devastated the great plains and all but dried up an already depressed american economy in the 1930�s.</p>

At the same time, the climatic effects all but dried up an already depressed american economy in the 1930�s creating millions of dollars in damages.</p>
