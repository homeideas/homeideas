An Innova Helmsley Light Grey &amp; Hague Blue Inframe Kitchen</p>
<p>The exact cost of converting a garage will depend on a variety of factors, including the extension’s new use and the quality of finish you’d like. From a range of configurations and standard designs this tool will help you build your dream kitchen, customising as you go, as well as get a guide price. Offer ends 21st december 2020. For example, though you might get a great new living room for around £6,000, if you’re putting in an expensive kitchen or bathroom, then costs will be far more. If you have a large kitchen of 20m 2 or more, then you can fit 16 or more units and around 6 appliances.</p>
