<p>We used a competent fitter to install our kitchen and they found it very easy to work with. Find out more about our delivery services, charges and where we deliver to. Enjoy big savings with diy kitchens vouchers &amp; discount codes. The pricing is really competitive for the quality of the cupboards and fittings and they come assembled which is a bonus. I fitted the kitchen myself excluding the worktop and found it so easy.</p>
