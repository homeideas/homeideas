35+ Ideas about White Kitchen at TheyDesign</p>
<p>If you have several clean white appliances and other similarly colored kitchen elements, you want to opt for matching white cabinets for continuity. I love white kitchens, but hated the white cabinets/white/light counters/white on white appliances that were so trendy in the 90s. This cozy kitchen features white cabinetry and tiled countertops, as well as a full set of modern stainless steel appliances. White appliances exude an appearance of cleanliness (even if you haven�t wiped down the surfaces in few weeks). Check out this post for the 12 gorgeous slate appliances with white cabinets ideas to apply in different kitchen styles.</p>
