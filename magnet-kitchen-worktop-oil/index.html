<p>A great way to stop your worktop from warping or bowing, the application of danish oil to your worktop will also make it water resistant. Modern kitchen worktop oils are highly refined and are blended with solvents to thin and aid penetration into the surface of the wooden work top. As you can image, the prices for these vary widely, too, from £50 to more than £500 for the same length of worktop. It’ll keep it looking good for longer. When the sink is in use and the dishes are drying on the draining board it just looks like a normal sink.</p>
