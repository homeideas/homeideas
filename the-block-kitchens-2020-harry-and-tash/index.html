<p>Harry and tash’s kitchen successfully navigated the transition from the 1920s area of the home to the contemporary area. It’s all about the details for father and daughter team, harry and tash. It’s always the week so many of us look forward to each season, and as i suspected there were some major wins and some unfortunate sins we need to discuss. No shortage of bench space with that 4.3m island (aka the catwalk), and, in a world where deep island benches are the trend, it was exciting to see a longer, narrower version. At the beginning of the week, harry and tash thought kitchen week was going to be a walk in the park, but they faced a number of hurdles before delivering what is a beautiful kitchen.</p>
