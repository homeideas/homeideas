25 TRADITIONAL KITCHEN DESIGNS FOR A ROYAL LOOK White</p>
<p>And, it�s easy to see why with these 58 traditional, modern, cottage and contemporary white kitchens that are anything but boring. A kitchen with white cabinets all the time looks fantastic. One great way to break up the use of white is with a dark colored countertop! While going for dark colors may seem to go against the accepted perception that a kitchen should have bright and warm colors, you might be surprised at how well it works for most kitchens. The dark colors make the white and grey marble countertops shimmer in the sun.</p>
