While going for dark colors may seem to go against the accepted perception that a kitchen should have bright and warm colors, you might be surprised at how well it works for most kitchens. The dark colors make the white and grey marble countertops shimmer in the sun.</p>

Elegant White Shaker Kitchen With Dark Wood</p>
<p>A gray and white color scheme draws from the natural stone to prevent the small kitchen from looking too busy. An under counter microwave is fixed in white shaker cabinets adorning nickel hardware and white and gray quartzite countertop fitted with a prep sink located below upper cabinets finished with glass knobs facing black leather counter stools are positioned on dark matte oak wood floors in front of a white island topped with a gray and white quartzite countertop lit by hudson valley lighting. Love how this kitchen renovation creates an open feel for our clients to their dining room and office and a better transition to back yard! There are many types of flooring that you can choose to balance the dark color of the dark cabinets. Off white kitchen cabinets with dark granite countertops.</p>
