<p>The service and the staff are fantastic, ever helpful, courteous, informative and friendly. You can still view the kitchens online or through a brochure as well as receive design advice (see details below).

Modus fireplace Dan likes doesn�t take floor space up</p>
<p>Good quality kitchens supplied with the knowledge that i have the support and backup of a national company. What is not in doubt is that howdens is a big beast in this sector, claiming that in 2015 it supplied more than 400,000 kitchens, 2.4m doors and 750,000 appliances to uk homes. Kitchens needed an overall score of more than 70% to become a best buy. The service and the staff are fantastic, ever helpful, courteous, informative and friendly. I have just received a quote for a relatively small kitchen.</p>
