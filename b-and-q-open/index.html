Homebase Hygena Arletta Cream</p>
<p>Since 2015, b&amp;q has been closing a number of stores. B&amp;q reopens all 288 stores amid lockdown. The hardware retailer has been slowly reopening stores over the last few weeks and has now opened its last two outlets. Charges refer to the value of goods being delivered and excludes delivery from stores or services. Will b&amp;q stay open in the second lockdown?</p>
