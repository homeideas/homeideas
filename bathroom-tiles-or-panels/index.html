The Claro Bath Panel By Pivotech Http Www Pivotech Com Au Shower Screens Bath Panels Bathroom Design Ba Bath Panel Bathroom Styling Bathroom Interior</p>
<p>This tiling will have been laid by a design team and professional contractor using a tile adhesive. The metro tiles are zoned around the bath and shower with gloss olive shaker bath panelling on the side of the bath. Although tiles are also waterproof the grout around them is a hotbed for mould and even if you clean them regularly there always seems to be more. Bathroom wall panels or shower wall panels or wet wall panels are a durable and waterproof alternative to tiles for your shower space or washroom. Put some cladding strips on the tile or other surfaces first.</p>
