<p>Kitchens appear in a series of layouts, from common to sleekly minimalist. The thing that we also love from this traditional kitchen design is that the designer also uses black color in some other detailing in the room. Black double wall oven is inserted into the dark wood cabinetry in this kitchen with white subway tile backsplash and white upper cabinets that create balance to the layout. Black kitchen cabinets in small kitchen. A good example exists in the photo of a small kitchen above.</p>
