While “black blizzards” constantly menaced plains states in the 1930s, a massive dust storm 2 miles high traveled 2,000 miles before. In one year during the great depression, it�s estimated that 6,500 people were killed trying to hop on moving freight trains. One monster dust storm reached the atlantic ocean.</p>

Pin on Dust Bowl &amp; Great Depression</p>
<p>Not only was there financial loss from the great depression, but there was also a natural catastrophe that lasted for years. When the white dust bowl migrants arrived, they displaced many of the minority workers. The life of a hobo was not an easy one though. The drought and wind that hit in the early 1930�s left little grass and few trees on the land, as well as nothing to hold the topsoil down. The dust bowl decade was known as the dirty 30�s and the storms became known as black blizzards.</p>
