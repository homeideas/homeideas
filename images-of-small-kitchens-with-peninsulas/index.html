Contemporary Kitchen with Ushaped, Pendant light, Transom</p>
<p>A small house or apartment can benefit from having a kitchen peninsula. Small doesn�t have to mean boring when it comes to kitchen design. Doing so can create a great opportunity to add a peninsula in the vacant space. When space comes at a premium, you can�t afford to waste any of it—even the hidden space inside your cabinets. Peninsulas are one of my favorite design aspects because they lend themselves to a casual eating area for breakfast with the family or a good place for company to gather during parties.</p>
