<p>Assembly was easy and i didn’t have any problems with it at all. I like the rigid kitchen carcass that is pre built and the range of options available. At b&amp;q we offer standard delivery, named day delivery and bulk delivery services to help you get everything you need for your diy project, direct to your door.</p>

Delivery guys were fantastic, so helpful, no rush and were worthy of a tip. Kitchen design has never been so easy! We had to suspend delivery for 11 months until our extension was finally ready. Diy kitchens, rather than communicate with their customers and just kept letting people down.</p>

<p>Of particular note is the quality of the products and standard of finish. It didn�t turn up til 7 at night. Kitchen design has never been so easy! The only part i�m not so sure about is the design process given that this isn�t a service they offer. However, having removed the plastic from the kitchen unit doors after the delayed fitting, the upper panel of the pull out larder is a different colour than the rest of the kitchen.</p>

<p>A great looking product that fits perfectly. If you live in certain parts of the uk, it may take a little longer for a next day home delivery order to arrive, or you may be living within a vendor delivery exclusion zone. Our free online kitchen planner will allow you to design your very own kitchen. I have the broadoak painted kitchen from diy kitchens painted in farrow ball light blue, we were very happy with the whole process. Diy custom kitchens were easy to deal with and all at a reasonable price.</p>

Hi diy kitchens, i came on to your site via the freestanding washer &amp; dryer and was very impressed with your solution. Assembly was easy and i didn’t have any problems with it at all.</p>

<p>They�ve now said that they�re going to start keeping stocks of some of the painted door ranges. The lack of a service void can cause problems and unnecessary work. Significantly cheaper than any of the high street/ independent quotes. Diy kitchens stock a huge range of discount kitchens, cheap kitchen units, doors, handles, sinks &amp; taps at trade prices. Showroom had the full range installed which was good and the staff there helped me with using the online design but were not at all pushy and didn’t try up selling everything.</p>

Thanks for your help regards eamon By diy kitchens hi, with the inframe kitchen range the frame of the door is attached to the unit, which then makes the internal gap smaller and does not accommodate a lot of mechanisms. Customer service was impeccable and the kitchen is of the highest quality and i believe will stand the test of time for many years to come.</p>

<p>To those of you who have diy kitchens, from looking on their website i like the look of the broadoak painted range but they talk about the f&amp;b colour chart and after reading of the problems people on mn have had with f&amp;b paint i am slightly nervous about the practicality. We had to suspend delivery for 11 months until our extension was finally ready. The showroom is beautiful, with much more choice than i envisioned. The customer chose platinum delivery.
