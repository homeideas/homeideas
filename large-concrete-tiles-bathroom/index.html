<p>Although its been around since Roman times concrete became the building material of choice for high-rise and commercial architecture as we rebuilt after the war. Concrete tiles are water-resistant and slip-resistant since many. In many residential and commercial locations the walls and floors of a bathroom are refurbished with concrete look bathroom tiles to give a touch up to old dull bathrooms. From bedroom bathroom and living room floor tiles to outside patio and slip-resistant tiles CTM has the perfect design and finish for every setting. Add some color pattern and visual interest without painting the walls or totally taking away the brightness you love about your white bathroom with cement tiles.</p>
