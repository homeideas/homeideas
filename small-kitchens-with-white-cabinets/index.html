L Shaped French Country Kitchen White Color Scheme</p>
<p>If you are looking for a hot kitchen look that will stand the test of time, white kitchen cabinets can do no wrong. This small kitchen table matches the white and wood finish of the cabinets. I showed you 10 of the white kitchens last week, but today i’m featuring 10 that bucked the trend and went with wood cabinets instead. There are certain colors that simply work best with a kitchen. This tiny kitchen is inspired by the classic look of 1950s kitchens.</p>
