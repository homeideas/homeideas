<p>Building materials (45) bricks, blocks &amp; lintels (2) blocks (2) aerated blocks (1) dense blocks (1) cement &amp; aggregates (15) aggregates (3) cement (3) concrete (2) decorative stones &amp; gravel (4) mortar (1) sand. B&amp;q told me that their reserve and collect system is based on what is in stock at close of business the night before so it all seems just a little bit pointless to me :mad: B &amp; q reserve and collect. Since the coronavirus outbreak they now leaving items at customersï¿½ front doors to reduce contact.
