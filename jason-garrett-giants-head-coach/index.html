Dallas Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett (left</p>
<p>Jason garrett never addressed the media after his time as the cowboys head coach came to an end after some twisting in the wind early this year, but he got his chance on a tuesday conference call. Jason garrett is sticking in the nfc east, with the former cowboys head coach reaching a deal friday to take over the giants� offense. Before becoming temple’s head coach in 2012, rhule spent one year with the giants as an assistant offensive line coach on tom coughlin’s staff. Dallas� meeting with the washington football team for first place in the nfc east will happen without garrett on the sideline. Jason garrett is in his first season as the giants� offensive coordinator.</p>
