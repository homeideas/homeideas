<p>But, this is another post about a homeowner who was over it. The night and day transformation from ugly, honey oak to beautiful, smooth white makes me so happy. I have tackled a great deal of oak cabinet client projects, so i thought i would share some tips and tricks for painting oak cabinets that i have learned along the way, if you’re looking to give yours a refresh. This can create an impact when done as an accent wall or in throw cushions or other fabrics. In fact it was a mix of orangey pine and yellow oak.</p>
