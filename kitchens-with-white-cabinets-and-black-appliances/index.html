slate gray appliances in kitchen AFTER Granite counter</p>
<p>58 white kitchens that are anything but vanilla bright, cheery and timeless, white remains the kitchen color of choice. The 1990s homes in sun city west had open, airy kitchens (granted it was white walls and the light pickled oak cabinets) but i have yet to see one remodeled with dark cherry cabinets, stainless steel appliances (or black ones) and very busy granite countertops and backsplashes that didn’t feel as though it was about to come crashing down on. Everyone has stainless steel appliances; This white simple and sleek kitchen design adds a bold look with its full marble island. For those suffering from white kitchen overload, you may want to consider another classic color, black—in particular, dark cabinetry.</p>
