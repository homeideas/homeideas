<p>This quaint kitchen expands itself with the use of white cabinets and matching fridge doors. Beadboard is a lightweight and versatile product perfect for backsplashes. Meanwhile, the lovely blue of the island base brings a cool accent color and complements the use of brown. When you have a kitchen designed with white cabinets and black granite countertops, it�s like working with a clean slate. The marble, subway tile backsplash is a luxurious touch.</p>
