Harry Potter themed Monopoly project Made on a</p>
<p>September 6 at 2:41 am · harry and tash may not have nailed the brief, but boy have they nailed a beautiful guest bathroom! High scores and… the block 2020 kitchen week: As for tash, she loves a project and a good spreadsheet, but those things alone don’t build a house. No shortage of bench space with that 4.3m island (aka the catwalk), and, in a world where deep island benches are the trend, it was exciting to see a longer, narrower version. The beautiful light in the walk in wardrobe was a highlight.</p>

Pin by Heather Harry Frady on Wall Treatments in 2020</p>
<p>Experience level harry has renovation experience but he wouldn’t call himself an expert. Last week, we looked at each team’s living and dining areas, completing the downstairs open plan kitchen zones that our teams on the block have created. The long open shelves were a missed opportunity for storage solutions in the kitchen. Darren was a huge fan of the black fingerless pull handles and the sleek elements of the bench top from ceasarstone. The walk in robe had a huge amount of space, the only criticism was the hanging rack was too high.</p>
